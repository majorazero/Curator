Some kind of curator app.

# Using the App
-
[The app is currently deployed!](https://shrouded-falls-26640.herokuapp.com/)

# App Basics
-
Do you feel like your taste buds subscribe to the statiscal average of 1000 strangers? Probably not, you're no sheeple, you're a self described foodie and you want the world to know. So unplug yourself from our oppressive culinary overlords (Yelp) and use our app instead.

With Curators, you can form your own selected group of tastemakers and pass judgement amongst yourselves.

 - Set your curated entries to public so the world can know, or hide them from an undeserving world.
 - Watch your palate acknowledged as your group accumulates followers.
 - Follow your fellow revolutionaries' curated groups.  

Beat the system, show everyone that <b>you're better than Yelp. </b>

Disclaimer: Our app uses Yelp's API.
